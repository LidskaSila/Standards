Dates
=====
- Correct order for date entry is day, month, year.
- Use spaces between numbers (eg. `24. 12. 2016`, ~~`24.12.2016`~~ is forbidden).
- `RRRR-MM-DD` is also correct but don't use it for data output to end user
- Date range uses `-` to join date entries. Don't forget dots (eg. `24.-26. 12. 2016`). There are no spaces around `-`. Another case is `1. 1. 2016 â€“ 31. 12. 2017` where there are spaces around `-`.
- in rare cases `DD.MM.RRRR` is possible (`01.02.1993`)

Times
=====

- Recommended format for time entries is `<hours>.<minutes>` (eg. `8.31` or `12.59`).
- `:` can be used too (eg. `8:45` and `08:45`). Previous format is encouraged.
- Time ranges are again joined using `-` and there are no spaces around (eg. `7:45-8:00`).
