GitFlow
=======
We use GitFlow as a git branching model. [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is a great UI tool for GitFlow but it's available only for OS X or Win. Although, using a GitFlow tool is encouraged so no mistakes are made (GitFlow sometimes requires higher amount of commands to be launched and when that happens, mistakes are often made).
 
Commit Messages
===============

Try to describe in a commit message what's included in a commit.

Emojis can be used, it brings fun to the git (https://github.com/dannyfritz/commit-message-emoji).

When closing issue, don't forget to reference it in the commit message (https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).
